# Installation

This has currently only been tested on Chrome 126, Firefox 126, and briefly on Microsoft Edge.

## Chrome / Chromium

Go to the Google Chrome Webstore and download [the extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/new-tab-for-school/linelfnpolifceiffnpbnibebpamkald)

## Firefox 

Go [here](https://mud-ali.github.io/NewTab/) and click the link in the 
middle of the page. It should prompt you to install the extension.

Alternatively, you should be able to download and extract the same zip file from the 
[releases](https://github.com/mud-ali/NewTabv4/releases) tab. Right click the .xpi file and open with Firefox, or drag the .xpi into a new firefox tab.
