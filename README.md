# NewTab v4

An extension I use to put my school schedule on my new tab page. 
Gets data from the last opened Powerschool account, (currently only tested for BCA's instance).

Work in progress.


# Installation

This has currently only been tested on Chrome 126, Firefox 126, and briefly on Microsoft Edge.

## Chrome / Chromium

Please download the latest zip file from
the [releases](https://github.com/mud-ali/NewTabv4/releases) tab. Extract the zip to find a .crx file inside.

You can go to the page `chrome://extensions` and drag the .crx file from your file manager onto the website. You may need to
enable developer mode. This should prompt you to install the extension. If this doesn't work[^1], please create an 
issue on the Github issues tab.

## Firefox 

For Firefox, you should be able to download and extract the same zip file from the 
[releases](https://github.com/mud-ali/NewTabv4/releases) tab. Right click the .xpi file and open with Firefox, or drag the
.xpi into a new firefox tab. 


[^1]: There is a known issue with the extension being automatically disabled on Windows that can be fixed by modifying the registry.
